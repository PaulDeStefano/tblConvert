Why tblConvert
--------------
The primary purpose of this program is to take published data expressed 
as the sum or difference of values and reconstruct the original, raw values.
This is common in scientific journals, for example, where publishing the 
difference between two values as well as both of the values would be redundant, 
since just one value and the difference communicates the same information.
Of course, in order to make comparisons or calcuations with the data, it is 
often necesssary to reconstruct all of the original values.  So, this program 
helps quickly transform value differences to raw values and vice-versa.
